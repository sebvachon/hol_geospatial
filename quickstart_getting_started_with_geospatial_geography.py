	"> It's worth noting here that the scenario in the next three sections is more akin to what a person would do with a map application on their mobile phone, rather than how geospatial data would be used in fictional business setting. This was chosen intentionally to make this guide and these queries more relatable to the person doing the guide, rather than trying to create a realistic business scenario that is relatable to all industries, since geospatial data is used very differently across industries."
	
	"Before you begin the scenario, switch the active schema back to the shared database and make sure the output format is either GeoJSON or WKT, as you will be using another website to visualize the query results. Which output you choose will be based on your personal preference - WKT is easier for the casual person to read, while GeoJSON is arguably more common. The GeoJSON visualization tool is easier to see the points, lines, and shapes, so this guide will be showing the output for GeoJSON."

You need to make a shopping run to Best Buy and the liquor store, as well as grab a coffee at a coffee shop.

Are there other shops you could stop at along the way?"

	"In the image above, the blue map location icon represents the POINT object location. Now you know where you are!"
	
	"#### Find the Closest Locations"
	
	"In the next step, you are going to run queries to find the closest Best Buy, liquor store, and coffee shop to your current location from above. These queries are very similar and will do several things:"
	
	"* One will query the electronics view, the other two will query the food & beverages view, applying appropriate filters to find the thing we're looking for."
	
	"* All queries will use the `ST_DWITHIN` function in the where clause to filter out stores that aren't within the stated distance. The function takes two points and a distance to determine whether those two points are less than or equal to the stated distance from each other, returning true if they are and false if they are not. In this function, you will use the coordinates column from each view to scan through all of the Best Buys, liquor stores, or coffee shops and compare them to your current location `POINT`, which you will construct using the previously used `ST_MAKEPOINT`. You will then use 1600 meters for the distance value, which is roughly equivalent to a US mile."
	
	"* Note that in the queries below, the syntax `ST_DWITHIN(...) = true` is used for readability, but the `= true` is not required for the filter to work. It is required if you were to need an `= false` condition."
	
	"* All queries will also use the `ST_DISTANCE` function, which actually gives you a value in meters representing the distance between the two points. When combined with order by and limit clauses, this will help you return only the row that is the smallest distance, or closest."
	
	"* Also note in `ST_DISTANCE` that you use the constructor `TO_GEOGRAPHY` for your current location point instead of the `ST_MAKEPOINT` constructor that you used earlier in `ST_DWITHIN`. This is to show you that that `TO_GEOGRAPHY` is a general purpose constructor where `ST_MAKEPOINT` specifically makes a `POINT` object, but in this situation they resolve to the same output. Sometimes there is more than one valid approach to construct a geospatial object."

	"> You may feel that these last few queries were a bit long and repetitive, but remember that the intention of this guide was to walk you through the progression of building these longer, more complicated queries by illustrating to you what happens at each step through the progression. By understanding how functions can be combined, it helps you to understand how you can do more advanced things with Snowflake geospatial features!"
